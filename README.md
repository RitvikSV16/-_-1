Simple classification project using the standard dataset that is iris dataset. I have used the the sklearn.datasets library to directly load the iris dataset, so no need of downloading the dataset.
In this model I have used KNeighborsClassifier and done hyperparameter tuning and found that taking the parameter n_neighbors=2 produces great results.
Done multiple graphs such as correlation, scatterplots, barcharts for exploratory data anlysis.
Finally the confusion matrix
